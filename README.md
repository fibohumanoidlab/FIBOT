# Introduction
The decision of the player is an important part of the match that can lead to victory. A good decision can measure the intelligence of the robot. In 2022, our team uses a state machine to create an algorithm. However, a state machine has some disadvantages compared to a behavior tree. For example, the behavior tree can be coded in a node and connected with other nodes like a tree. itâ€™s able to overwrite the behavior node or recreate the tree with the same behavior node. Moreover, our system is developed using ROS2 which has a behavior tree extension.

# Installation
This package use extends the py_trees package with behaviors, idioms, a tree manager, and command line tools that are suited for the ROS2 ecosystem.
To enable the package, first, we must install the following package.

## Install py_trees_ros package
```
git clone https://github.com/splintered-reality/py_trees_ros.git
```
## Install py_tree_ros_tutorials
```
git clone https://github.com/splintered-reality/py_trees_ros_tutorials.git
```
## install py_tree_interface
```
git clone https://github.com/splintered-reality/py_trees_ros_interfaces.git
```
Now, we can learn py_tree tutorials from this website [py_tree_tutorial](https://py-trees-ros-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.1.x/index.html).

## Optional
if you want some visualization, you can install the py_trees_ros_viewer package
```
git clone https://github.com/splintered-reality/py_trees_ros_viewer.git
```
For more information about installing, can check on this git [ splintered-reality /py_trees_ros ](https://github.com/splintered-reality/py_trees_ros).

## About the project
In this project, we create a humanoid soccer robot decision system using a behavior tree algorithm. Moreover, we create the event node to simulate the event such as the position of the ball relates to the robot and the id of the robot to determine which robot is nearest to the ball. Then, we create the behavior node and tree to integrate the system. 


# Quickstart
This package has a launch file that launches all nodes include of Ball_node Root_node and robot_id node
```
ros2 launch robot_decision node.launch.py
```

The ball node is a node that provides a topic when the robot detects the ball.
The root node is a node that creates the behavior tree as it was designed.
robot_id_node is a node that provide a topic robot id to simulate which robot is stay nearest to the ball.
Use this command line to visualize the result and the behavior.

```
## Conclusion
A behavior tree algorithm can use to create a robot decision system perfectly. However, with the behavior tree algorithm, we can create a more complex decision system. For example, we can add a behavior node that checks robot pos and will this pos determine that the robot will fall so, we can prevent. If the sensor sends the information that the robot is falling so, the decision system must stop all action and make the robot stand again. If the robot is going to kick the ball which way is the robot going to kick?
